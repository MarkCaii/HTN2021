<h1 align="center">Schedule Master</h1>

Schedule Master is a web application that takes the user's inputs in the form of a Google Calendar event. These events contain the title to their task, the desired time spent doing their task, and their priority level of that specific task. With all of this considered, Schedule Masters sorts the tasks given to it based on the priority level the user assigned to it from high to low and imports the newly made schedule into the user's own Google Calendar.
